          <h2 class="m-heading">Community Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            Pendect is built on a set of guidelines to ensure a consistent
            quality of content, an equal playing field for each member of the
            community and a democratic approach to journalism. Our guidelines
            are constantly evolving as our community grows.

            <h4 class="pb-2">Source</h4>
            <p>
              All sources must have a reputation for upholding facts and need to
              have an editorial oversight. Furthermore, sources that rely on
              extremist views, rumours or gossip, or only personal opinions are
              not valid.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="pb-2">Language & Tone</h4>
            <p>
              Pentributors are urged to uphold the community’s standards,
              including neutrality of language and tone, originality of wording
              and factuality of content.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="pb-2">Opinions</h4>
            <p>
              News cards should never show the Pentributor’s opinion. Opinions
              of public figures are allowed as long as quoted and marked as
              such.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="pb-2">Review Process</h4>
            <p>
              To avoid false, untruthful or fragmentary information, each card
              is reviewed by at least two other Pentributors before being
              published. Therefore ensuring the community’s standard of quality.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="pb-2">Categories & Tags</h4>
            <p>
              Each card has to be filed under one single category. Tags for
              people, locations and organisations are added automatically,
              though Pentributors are given the option to add or change them if
              necessary.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h4 class="pb-2">Topics</h4>
            <p>
              A topic is either generated when there are more than three cards
              for a particular event, or added by a Pentributor when seen as
              relevant. Topics consist of cards that are linked to one specific
              event.
